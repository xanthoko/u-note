## u-note
An app that tracks the missed notes of a student.


The student sets the classes he attends and the day of the week the take place. Each day, a notification pops up asking the student wether he attended the class. If not, with a tap on it, the app saves the date and helps the student to organize the notes of the classes he is missing.
